Hamming in 1950 to detect. Hamming invented these linear error-correcting codes to detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. The linear error-correcting code that encodes four bits of data into seven bits by adding three parity bits. Hamming’s (7,4) algorithm can either correct any single-bit error, or detect all single-bit and two-bit errors as further described in. Error-correcting codes are widely adopted in many kinds of transmission (including WiFi, cell phones, communication with satellites and spacecraft, and digital television) and storage (RAM, disk drives, flash memory, CDs,etc.).\n","Hamming discovered a code in which a four-bit message is transformed into a seven-bit codeword. The generator matrix (G), parity-check matrix (H) discovered by Hamming is shown in fig. 2 and the Hamming’s Decoder Matrix (R) as shown in fig. 3.
